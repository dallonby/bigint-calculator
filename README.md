# BigInt Calculator

This project is a desktop application built with TypeScript and Electron that functions as a calculator for BigInt numbers. It allows users to input numbers in both hexadecimal and decimal formats, perform basic arithmetic operations, and switch the sign of the numbers.

## Features

- Input BigInt numbers in hexadecimal or decimal format.
- Display the equivalent value in the alternate format (hex or decimal) in smaller greyed text.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Switch the sign of a BigInt number.
- User-friendly interface designed to resemble a traditional calculator.
